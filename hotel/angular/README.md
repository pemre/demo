# Hotel Angular
An Angular based front-end for the [fake hotel API](../api).

## Development server

Install `angular-cli` if not installed already: `$ npm install -g @angular/cli`

Run `npm install` to install node modules.

Now you can run `ng serve` for the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload when you change source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
